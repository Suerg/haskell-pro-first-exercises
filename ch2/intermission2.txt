1.
  a) 8 + 7 * 9 -> 8 + (7 * 9) -> 8 + 63 -> 71
  b) (8 + 7) * 9 -> 15 * 9 -> 135
  -- so yes the parentheses do change the value
  -- since * is higher precedence than +

2.
  no the parentheses don't change the value of the
  function since they simply raise the precedence 
  of *, which is already higher than +.

3.
  yes the parentheses change the value of the function.
  as they make (+) 2 9 have higher precedence than (/) x
  or not.
